Blackjack - Program considerations.

/* General, Deck, Shuffle */

- Deck of cards = 52 cards, no wild cards.
- Number of decks in a shoe (up to 8?).  Test with one deck, keep modular for future expansion.
- Shuffle cards: shuffle once, store in a stock array.  Deal next card (last card from array, chop end?)
- Set shuffle point, shuffle after hand in which the shuffle point is reached.

Possible alignment with project proposal via Charles Mousseau. 

He is seeking a front-end dev to implement Casino card simulations / etc. in conjunction with his back-end programming.

Under serious consideration.
